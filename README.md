## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd discord-bot
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your Discord bot token in an environment variable or directly in the code (not recommended for production).

5. Run the bot:
   ```

   ```

## Commands

You can extend the bot by adding new commands in the `src/commands` directory. Each command should implement the necessary logic to respond to user inputs.
